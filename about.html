        <h2>Snowboarding</h2>

        <p class="homepgabtp">
          I have been an avid snowboarder since I was just a kid. Growing up my
          family would visit Washington and Canada often, where we would always
          make time to hit the slopes. Vacations to the mountains were always my
          favorite. Mountains over beaches any day! I recently lived in Colorado
          for two years and was extremely lucky to beable to go almost everyday
          of the season. I was recently able to check off the biggest item on my
          bucket list which was to go snowboarding in Japan. I am already making
          plans to return!

        <h2>DOGS! All the dogs.</h2>

        <p class="homepgabtp">
          I love Dogs. I think they are the best thing ever created and I will
          always try to pet a dog when I see one. "Can I pet that dog?" I was
          blessed with the best sog ever named Kevin. he and I shared a bond
          that is unexplainable. The only bad thing about dogs is the amount of
          time they are given to us for. As hard as it was to say goodbye to my
          first dog Kevin, I am excited for the new Adventure I will be on with
          my new puppy Arthur.
