        <h2>Grocery List</h2>

        <p class="homepgabtp">
          As an exercise in html and Css we created a grocery list and were
          instruced to make certain styling changes. After meeting all the
          required task, I wanted to see how creative I could get and just have
          some fun with it. I really enjoyed working on this and seeing my
          creativity and vision come to life in real time as I was making style
          changes. Themed off of my desire to go back to Japan mainly for the
          food I made a Japanese themes grocery list. The list included links to
          every item for a quick purchase at your "local" Japanese grocery
          store.

        <h2>Combonation Workshop</h2>

        <p class="homepgabtp">
          In this workshop assignment, the goal was to use javascript to display
          a message with a lock combonation for the user through a dialog box.
          The numbers were to be calculated through assigned variables that
          would give the correct number through an arthimetic operator. Like the
          grocery list, after completed all requirements I had some fun with it.
          Trying to understand javascript a bit more and seeing how it can make
          something function and be interactable with the user I found a pretty
          cool code through google AI and applied it to my page displaying a pad
          lock that the user can lock or unlock by clicking it. Doing this was
          helpful to see what codes were written to accomplish this, making
          learning a little more fun!
